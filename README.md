# Recovery AI 🛡️
Recovery AI is a fitness injury prevention application designed to help users train smarter by identifying unsafe training patterns before injury occurs. Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus primarily on performance and progression, Recovery AI prioritizes recovery awareness, workload management, and explainable injury risk insights.
This project is being developed as a capstone software engineering project and combines full-stack development, machine learning, and exploratory quantum computing research.

## Problem Statement 🚨
Many fitness applications encourage users to increase training volume and intensity without adequately accounting for recovery, rest days, or sudden workload spikes. This can lead to overuse injuries, burnout, and long-term setbacks—especially for recreational athletes and self-guided lifters.
Users often lack:
•	Clear visibility into their cumulative training load
•	Early warnings when training volume increases too rapidly
•	Understandable explanations for why injury risk is increasing

## Solution Overview 💡
Recovery AI analyzes workout history to assess injury risk using a Low / Moderate / High classification system. The application evaluates factors such as:
•	Weekly training load
•	Sudden increases in training volume
•	Rest days between workouts
•	Consistency and recovery patterns
Instead of generating workouts, Recovery AI acts as a decision-support tool, helping users know when to push and when to rest—and explaining those recommendations clearly.

## Key Features ✨
•	Secure user authentication
•	Manual workout logging (exercise type, volume, intensity)
•	Persistent workout history
•	Weekly training load calculation
•	Detection of rapid volume increases
•	Rest day tracking
•	Injury risk scoring (Low / Moderate / High)
•	Explainable risk reasoning
•	Basic recovery and training recommendations

## Artificial Intelligence Component 🤖
The core injury risk scoring is powered by a classical machine learning classification model trained on fitness and injury-related datasets containing thousands of data points.
The model:
•	Uses engineered features such as training load trends and recovery gaps
•	Outputs a discrete injury risk classification
•	Provides interpretable factors that explain the prediction
This ensures predictions are transparent, trustworthy, and actionable.

## Quantum Computing (Research Component) ⚛️
Recovery AI includes a non-production, exploratory quantum computing module used for academic comparison only.
•	Implements a small-scale quantum classifier using Qiskit
•	Applies quantum feature mapping to the same dataset used by the classical model
•	Compares performance and pattern detection capability
This component adds research value without impacting user-facing functionality or safety.

## Technology Stack 🧱
Frontend
•	Mobile or web-based UI (TBD during implementation)
•	User dashboards and data visualizations
Backend
•	RESTful API
•	Secure authentication
•	Business logic for training metrics
Database
•	Cloud-based database for users, workouts, and risk history
Machine Learning
